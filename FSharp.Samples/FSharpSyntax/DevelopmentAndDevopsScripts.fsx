Part 2: Using F# for development and devops scripts

The next set of suggestions relates to using F# for the various scripts that 
revolve around development activities: 
builds, continuous integration, deployment, etc.

For these kinds of small tasks, you need a good scripting language with a REPL. 
You could use PowerShell, or ScriptCS, or even Python. But why not give F# a go?

    - F# feels lightweight like Python (few or no type declarations).
    - F# can access .NET libraries, both the core ones and those downloaded via NuGet.
    - F# has type providers (a big advantage over PowerShell and ScriptCS) that 
        let you easily access a wide range of data sources.
     -All this in a concise, type-safe manner, with intellisense too!

Using F# in this way will allow you and your fellow developers to use F# code 
to solve practical problems.

A hidden agenda, of course, is that once your fellow developers get a chance 
to play with F#, they'll be hooked, and you'll be one step closer to using F# end to end!
